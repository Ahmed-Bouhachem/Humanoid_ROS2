# search, the iterated EKF, the map insert -- inside one timer callback on a single-threaded
# executor. Nothing takes IMU while that runs. Ten samples is 50 ms at a Mid360's 200 Hz, and an
# update on a dense indoor scan can exceed that, at which point the samples are gone: FAST-LIO
# integrates the whole gap on the last reading it saw. Standing that is nothing; turning, it is
# heading error sized by how busy the machine happened to be.

# 2000 is ten seconds of buffer. The samples are 300 bytes each.

# FAST-LIO fixes its gravity vector by averaging the first MAX_INI_COUNT IMU samples, and
# upstream sets that to 10. Its own paper asks for the sensor to be held STATIC for about two
# seconds while that happens; ten samples is only that long on a slow IMU, and at the Mid360's
# 200 Hz it is 50 ms.
#
# A balancing humanoid has no static pose. Fifty milliseconds does not average the sway, it
# samples one instant of it, so gravity comes out tilted by whatever the body was doing at
# that moment -- and every pose afterwards inherits that tilt, which lands on the floor plane
# and comes back as the costmap marking the floor.
#
# 1000 samples is five seconds at 200 Hz, rather more than the paper asks for and deliberately
# so: this robot is still settling for the first few seconds after spawn, and the extra
# averaging is free -- it sits inside the launch delay that already waits out the spawn drop.
