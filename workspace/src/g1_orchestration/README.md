# g1_orchestration

The behavior tree that composes navigation and manipulation into a mission, on
BehaviorTree.CPP **v4**. `ament_cmake`, C++20.

```

The tree decides *what* happens and in what order; the skills decide *how*. Nothing here plans,
moves a joint, or drives a costmap.

Nav2's own navigator links the same `libbehaviortree_cpp.so` this package does: there is one
BehaviorTree.CPP in the image and no v3 package, so a leaf here and a Nav2 BT node are the same
version. `behaviortree_ros2` is not in the image, which is why this package has its own
action-client base.

## Layout

One file per leaf, the layout `nav2_behavior_tree` uses.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `include/g1_orchestration/skills/`, `src/skills/` | One header and one source per leaf. |
| `ros_action_node.hpp` | Action-client base. Owns goal handling, cancellation and timeouts. |
| `skill_action_node.hpp` | Adds `judgeResult` for the `success`/`message` convention, so most leaves need only `fillGoal`. |
| `service_leaf.hpp` | The same for leaves that call a service and finish in one tick. |
| `ports.hpp` | Ports used by more than one leaf. |
| `registration.hpp`, `src/registration.cpp` | Binds classes to the names trees use. |

## Leaves

| Leaf | Wraps | Ports |
|---|---|---|
| `NavigateToPose` | Nav2 `/navigate_to_pose` | in `goal` as `"x;y;yaw"`, `frame_id`, `behavior_tree`; out `goal_yaw` |
| `ApproachObject` | `/g1_base_approach/approach_object` | `object_id`, `arm`, `working_yaw`, `use_current_heading`, `timeout_s` |
| `Retreat` | `/g1_base_approach/retreat` | `distance`, `timeout_s` |
| `Pick` | `/g1_manipulation_server/pick` | `object_id`, `arm` |
| `Place` | `/g1_manipulation_server/place` | `surface` (preferred), or `target` as `"x;y;z"` with `frame_id`; `arm` |
| `SetArmPosture` | `/g1_manipulation_server/set_arm_posture` | `group`, `named_target` |
| `ClearCostmaps` | Nav2 costmap clear services | `timeout_s`, `global_service`, `local_service` |
| `ClearOctomap` | MoveIt `/clear_octomap` | `timeout_s`, `service` |
| `AcquireArm` / `ReleaseArm` | `controller_manager` services | `timeout_s` |

Every action leaf also takes `server_timeout_s` (default 10.0), how long to wait for the server to
appear.

Action leaves send their goal on the first tick, answer RUNNING while it is in flight, and
**cancel rather than abandon** when halted. A failed leaf logs the server's own reason, so a
failure reads `did not complete: could not reach 'tucked'` rather than just failing.

`ApproachObject` requires either `working_yaw` or `use_current_heading`. Pass the staging goal's
`goal_yaw` rather than retyping the number:

```xml
<NavigateToPose goal="4.30;-5.60;1.5708" goal_yaw="{workbench_yaw}"/>
<ApproachObject object_id="red_cube" working_yaw="{workbench_yaw}"/>
```

## Adding a skill

A skill is a ROS action served by whichever package owns that domain, plus a leaf here that calls
it. Anything that writes a velocity belongs in `g1_locomotion`; anything that moves the arm belongs
in `g1_manipulation`. Nothing about the robot goes in this package.

1. **Define the action** in `g1_msgs`, and add it to that package's `CMakeLists.txt`. Give the
   result a `success` and a `message` so the leaf can use the shared result judging.
2. **Implement the server** in the owning package. Not here.
3. **Add the leaf**, a header and a source under `skills/`. Derive from `SkillActionNode` and the
   only thing left to write is `fillGoal`, because `judgeResult` already handles the
   `success`/`message` convention. Derive from `RosActionNode` instead when the result is not that
   shape, as Nav2's is not, or from `ServiceLeaf` and override `tick()` for a call that finishes in
   one tick. `skills/pick.cpp` and `skills/clear_costmaps.cpp` are the two shortest examples.
4. **Register it** in `src/registration.cpp` with `registerLeaf<OpenDoor>(factory, "OpenDoor",
   context)`, and list the source in `CMakeLists.txt`.
5. **Regenerate the Groot2 palette** and rebuild:

```bash
ros2 run g1_orchestration g1_bt_node_model src/g1_orchestration/trees/g1_orchestration_nodes.xml
```

Port descriptions become Groot2's tooltips, so write them for a tree author. `test_node_model`
fails if the palette drifts, and `test_tree_loads` fails if a tree names a leaf nobody registered.

## Trees

| Tree | Needs | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `pick_and_place.xml` | Nav2, `world:=navigation`, a map | Acquire, tuck, drive to a staging pose, close the last gap, pick, carry, drive to storage, close again, place, tuck, release. |
| `pick_and_place_in_place.xml` | `world:=manipulation` | The same skills with no driving. |
| `TuckBothArms` | subtree of the above | Both arms to `tucked`, each retried. |

The stations are **staging poses, not working poses**. Nav2 cannot park the robot where the arm
can reach anything: `xy_goal_tolerance` is 0.5 m and `robot_radius` 0.45, against an arm window
about 0.2 m wide. Each `NavigateToPose` goal is a pose Nav2 can legally reach, short of the
surface, and `ApproachObject` closes the rest against the measured object.

Named postures are driven per arm: `both_arms` currently fails to execute a named posture on this
stack while either arm alone succeeds; the cause is not yet found.

## The arm bracket belongs to the executor

A skill must release control authority cleanly on success or failure alike. At mission scope the
only place that can be guaranteed is around the whole tree, so the executor releases the arm and
hands on every exit path: success, tree failure, an exception while loading, and SIGINT. It is an
RAII guard rather than a call at the end, so the guarantee is a property of the type.

`ReleaseArm` exists as a leaf too, for a tree that wants to hand the arm back early. It always
reports SUCCESS: a release that failed the tree it is cleaning up after would be worse than
useless.

Acquiring is one `switch_controller` call. The always-active component owns all 29 body motors and
is already holding the arms through `arm_freeze_controller`, so the bracket trades that freeze for
`arm_trajectory_controller` in a single call. It has to be one, because the component leaves any
unclaimed joint unpowered and two calls would drop the arms in between. The hands are separate
component activations: a Dex3 is its own device on its own channels.

That one call is `STRICT`, and only the arm's is. `BEST_EFFORT` drops whichever controller it
cannot switch and applies the rest, still answering `ok`, so a trajectory controller that is loaded
but not yet configured leaves the request as a bare deactivation of the freeze and the arms fall. `STRICT` is all-or-nothing but refuses a switch that is already done, so the two controllers'
states are read first and an arm already in the wanted state is left alone. The hands keep
`BEST_EFFORT`: nothing is displaced there, so there is no half of a pair to apply on its own, and a
hand that will not come up must still leave the arm usable. `planArmSwitch` is that decision on its
own, with no service calls in it, so `test_authority_drift` can assert it directly.

## Running

The mission starts nothing else. The simulator, Nav2, MoveIt and the skills must already be up.

```bash
ros2 launch g1_bringup bringup.launch.py moveit:=true manipulation:=true pin_pelvis:=true world:=manipulation activate_arm:=true activate_arm_delay_s:=40.0
```

```bash
ros2 launch g1_orchestration mission.launch.py tree:=pick_and_place_in_place.xml
```

The full mission wants `mode:=localization nav:=true world:=navigation` instead.

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tree` | `pick_and_place.xml` | Which tree in `trees/` to run. |
| `groot2_port` | `1667` | ZeroMQ port, or `0` to disable the publisher. |
| `tick_rate_hz` | `10.0` | How often the tree is ticked. |

## Groot2

Groot2 runs as a separate desktop application and reaches the native executor at
`localhost:1667`.

**To watch a run:** start the mission, then choose Monitor and connect to `localhost:1667`. The
publisher only exists while a tree is running.

**To edit trees:** open `trees/g1_orchestration.btproj`. Once per project, use **Import Models**
and pick `trees/g1_orchestration_nodes.xml` beside it; Groot2 writes the model into the project
and remembers it. Tree files are symlinked into the install space, so a tree saved from Groot2 is
picked up by the next `ros2 launch` with no rebuild.

On the free tier, live monitoring is capped at 20 nodes per view and blackboard inspection,
breakpoints and node substitution are PRO-only. The editor itself is unrestricted.

## Tests

None need a simulator.

| Test | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_tree_loads` | Every shipped tree parses against the registered node set; the mission tree still has the leaves and retry wrappers it is supposed to; an unknown leaf is rejected; the port string conversions and their refusals. |
| `test_action_leaf` | A leaf ticked against a real server on the two threads the executor uses: a rejected goal fails the leaf instead of leaving it RUNNING, and an accepted one that succeeds reaches SUCCESS. |
| `test_node_model` | The checked-in Groot2 palette matches the registered nodes and their ports. |
| `test_authority_drift` | The acquire sequence against `g1_bringup`'s `activate_arm`: the same names, the arm first with the hands behind it, and the freeze controller still displaced in the same switch. Plus `planArmSwitch`, including that an incoming controller which is not loaded switches nothing at all. |
